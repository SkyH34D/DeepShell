# DeepShell

**DeepShell** is a command-line productivity tool based on [ShellGPT](https://github.com/TheR1D/shell_gpt) but powered by the **DeepSeek** AI model instead of ChatGPT. This tool provides streamlined generation of **shell commands, code snippets, and documentation**, reducing the need for external resources. It works on Linux, macOS, Windows, and is compatible with major shells (PowerShell, CMD, Bash, Zsh, etc.).
